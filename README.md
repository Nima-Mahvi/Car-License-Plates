# Car-License-Plates
Detecting car license plates and predicting their location using OpenCV and Random Forest.

This project aims to detect and predict car license plate numbers using various technologies, including OpenCV, Random Forest, and Tkinter.

## Project Overview:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Initially, the data related to car license plates is processed and converted into CSV format.
2. **Image Processing**: Images of car license plates are processed, and important features are extracted from them.
3. **Model Training**: The Random Forest model is trained to predict license plate numbers.
4. **Alphanumeric and Digit Detection**: Using the trained model, alphanumeric characters and digits of the license plates are detected.
5. **Location Prediction**: Based on the information obtained from the license plates, their locations are predicted.

## Technologies Used:

- OpenCV for image processing.
- Random Forest for model training.
- Tkinter for user interface.

## Usage:

1. Run `main.py` in your Python environment.
2. Select an image containing a car license plate.
3. Press the 'OK' button to start processing.
4. View the progress in the console.
